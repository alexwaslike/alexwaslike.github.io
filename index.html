          <p>My team of 3 programmers and 2 artists created a <b>cute-but-creepy action-adventure game</b> during my last semester of college called Bark.
          <P>Our challenge was two combine two unrelated game genres, so we mashed together animal collection games in the style of Nintendogs or Neko Atsume with surival-horror in the style of Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Don't Starve.
          <p>I was the team captain and the lead engineer. I really enjoyed creating this game and helping the other team members' visions come to life. I handled the production of the game, including setting the timeline and deadlines, creating asset lists, and keeping the scope under control.

          <p>The first assignment for my Video Game Design class during my last semester of college was to create a game that used <b>three essential features of Pac-Man: a maze, enemies, and collectibles.</b>
          <p>This assignment was used to determine team leaders for the semester-long group project, and I succesfully earned the title with this game.
          <p>I created an <b>unsettling first-person 3D adventure game</b> in which the player must reach the center of a maze without running out of "hope", which is drained when the player encounters a ghost and gained back if they pick up a ball of light.

          <p>During a Creative Coding class in college, I created a mandala generator that created a <b>unique mandala on beat with a heartbeat</b> detected from a pulse sensor. The project was one of several created during the semester, and used a pulse sensor hooked up to an Arduino Uno.
          <p>To use the version linked above, press the spacebar to generate a new mandala.

          <p>I created all of the <b>60+ sprites and animations during the 48-hour Glboal Game Jam</b> for a game called Inscription. Our 2-person team won <b>Best High Concept</b> out of the 14 games created at our site.
          <p>Inscription is a <b>procedurally generated sandbox game</b> in which the player has the ability to nurture or destroy a forest by casting spells. There are no text or instructions in the game; you learn spellcasting by observing other entities in the forest, including creatures and plants. These enteties respond to you, as the whole forest is connected to you and responds to your actions.

          <p>I worked for <b>EA Mobile</b> on a new collectible character game called Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes during the summer of 2015.
          <p>I designed and engineered an editor tool for Unity to help QA and designers test the battle systems. I made important design decisions for the tool that taught me about balancing code clarity with generalization and reusability.</p>

          <p>During the 2015 Global Game Jam, my team of 8 college and high school students created an <b>interactive narrative</b> called Wanted. We won <b>Most Polish and Best Art</b> at our location, pitted against 5 other teams.
          <p>As the only team member with game development experience, I engineered the game and helped the team learn how to create games in Unity.
