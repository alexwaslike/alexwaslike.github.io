      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <div class="content"><p>I'm a computer science student with a passion for video game development. I have experience in project leadership and software engineering, and I've been an artist by hobby since I could hold a crayon. I aspire to use my holistic approach to game development to <b>contribute to video games as an art form</b>.</p><p>I also want to <b>make the tech community a welcoming place for women and minorities</b>, so I co-founded a campus organization called Women in Computer Science dedicated to doing so.</p><p>I seek to <b>join an ambitious studio full of creative, passionate people as a software engineer</b> when I graduate in May.</p></div>

        <div class="projectItem"><p><a class="imageLink" href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/inscription" title="Inscription Game Jam page"><img class="icon" src="/inscriptionart/titleImage.png"></a></p><h3>Inscription</h3><p>I created all of the art assets for a game called Inscription on a two-person team for the 2016 Global Game Jam, which won Best High Concept of the 13 other games. Inscription is a procedurally generated sandbox game in which the player has the ability to nurture or destroy a forest by casting spells. There is no text or instructions in the game; you learn spellcasting by observing other entities in the forest, including creatures and plants. In addition, these enteties respond to you, as the whole forest is connected to you and responds to your actions. My partner completed the spellcasting aspect of the game for the jam, and I created over 60 sprites and animations for one character. We plan to complete the game post-jam. We currently only have a <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/inscription">Linux build which you can download here</a>, and you can see all of the <a href="/art.html#art">art assets I created during the jam here.</a></p></div>
        <div class="projectItem"><p><a class="imageLink" href="https://github.com/alexwaslike/NotPacMan" title="Not PacMan GitHub repo"><img class="icon" src="/games/splashImage.png"></a></p><h3>Not PacMan</h3><p>The first assignment for my Video Game Design class this semester was to create a game that used three essential features of Pac-Man: a maze, enemies, and collectibles. This assignment was used to determine team leaders for the semester-long group project, and I succesfully earned the title with this game. I created a first-person 3D game in which the player must reach the center of a maze without running out of "hope", which is drained when the player encounters a ghost and gained back if they pick up a ball of light. I engineered the game and created a few textures for the particle effects. You can download a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_M-lYgkQ_ZvMUxuTHp6aGRpT2M">.zip containing a Windows executable here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexwaslike/NotPacMan">view the GitHub repo here.</a></p></div>

I designed and engineered an editor tool for Unity to help QA and designers test the battle systems. I made important design decisions for the tool that taught me about balancing code clarity with generalization and reusability.</p></div>

You can <a href="/games/Builds.html">play the browser version of LoveBirds here</a> (requires a browser other than Chrome) and see the <a href="https://github.com/alexwaslike/lovebirds">repository here.</a> I managed the team schedule, asset requirements, and work allocation, and engineered the game.</div>

We won Most Polish and Best Art at our location, pitted against 5 other teams. As the only team member with game development experience, I engineered the game and helped the team learn. You can check out the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/wanted" title="Wanted Game Jam page">Global Game Jam page on Wanted here</a>, which includes a download for a .exe of the game.</p></div>

The project was one of several created during the semester, and used a pulse sensor hooked up to an Arduino Uno. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/alexwaslike/ProcessingHeartbeat">source code for the project here</a> and download the <a href="/games/heartbeat64.zip">win64 .exe here</a> or the <a href="/games/heartbeat32.zip">win32 .exe here</a>.</p></div></div>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="content"><p><h4>Games are my passion.</h4> I'm currently in my fourth year studying Computer Science at LSU, and I've spent the last four summers interning at video game studios. Most recently, I worked at EA Mobile in Austin on a new mobile collectible character game <a href="http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes">Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</a>. The previous two summers, I worked at <a href="http://www.pixeldashstudios.com/">Pixel Dash Studios</a>, an independent game studio local to Baton Rouge, best known for Road Redemption. The summer before I started college, I did a mentorship program at independent Austin studio Heatwave Interactive, where I first learned to write C# and use Unity3D, and where I developed my passion for creating games.</p>
        <p><h4>Programming is my technical means for artistic expression:</h4> I started coding at 12 to customize my Neopets page in HTML and CSS. Since then, I took 3 years of Java in high school and decided to major in computer science in college. I've always been a gamer, but my passion for programming shifted gears from web design to games when I started watching the Extra Credits series on game design on Penny Arcade. I created my first two games at Heatwave the summer before I started college, teaching myself Unity and C# along the way, and game development has been my focus ever since. I re-taught myself HTML and CSS to create this website from scratch; <a href="https://github.com/alexwaslike/alexwaslike.github.io">check out my GitHub repository for it here</a>. My use of programming as artistic expression is why I care so much about video games as an art form.</p>
        <p><h4>I'm dedicated to helping tech and gaming minorities feel welcomed.</h4> I'm the president and co-founder of a new student organization of 50+ members called Women in Computer Science. We hosted a <a href="http://wicsgamejam.com/" title="WICS Game Jam">game jam the weekend of November 6-8</a>, which I was primarily responsible for organizing, including fundraising, managing logistics, and marketing. We raised $4,200 in sponsorship and had 73 participants, 20+ volunteers, and 14 completed games. WICS also has regular tutoring sessions, professional development workshops, socials, and other events. If you're interested in learning more, contact wicslsu@gmail.com.</p>
        <p><h4>I'm active in the local game development community</h4> and have spoken three times at IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings and once at a New Orleans game developer meet-up. You can watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMnLcmWts0" title="Alexandra Willis free to play games livestream">presentation on free-to-play mobile games from the NOLA meet-up here</a>. I've regularly attended the IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings since Pixel Dash introduced me to them in the summer of 2013.</p>
        <p><h4>My hobbies</h4> include gaming (obviously), digital art, and traditional art. The first game I obsessed over was Kingdom Hearts, which remains one of my favorites to this day. Other all-time favorites include the Mass Effect series, The Endless Forest, Life is Strange, Spec Ops: The Line, Transistor (I study to that soundtrack!), Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Undertale, and Minecraft. I spend a lot of time on itch.io, checking on the latest innovations in experimental and artsy games. (...Also because it's cheap and I'm a broke college student.) <a href="http://wowsuchscotland.tumblr.com/" title="Study abroad blog">I spent a semester studying abroad in Scotland</a>, traveling to Ireland, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, England, and Poland. The photo at the top of the page was taken on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, Scotland. I still have a yearning for travel, and I have plans for more adventure in the future.</p></div>
