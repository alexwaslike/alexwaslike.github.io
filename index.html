      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <div class="content"><p>Hello, my name is Alexandra Willis and I'm a video game developer, student, and artist. I've been coding since I first learned HTML and CSS to customize my Neopets page at 12, and I'm right now I'm teaching myself how to combine game programming and art. I aspire to use these skills to make games that <b>contribute to video games as an art form</b>. I also want to <b>make tech a welcoming place for women and minorities</b>, which I'm working on by being the co-founder and president of a campus organization called Women in Computer Science.</p></div>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="content"><p><h4>Games are my passion.</h4> I've spent the last four summers working for video game studios, at both the indpedendent and corporate level. Most recently, I worked at EA Mobile in Austin on the upcoming mobile collectible character game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. The previous two summers, I worked at Pixel Dash, an independent game studio local to Baton Rouge, best known for Road Redemption. The summer before I started college, I did a mentorship program at independent Austin studio Heatwave Interactive, where I first learned to write C# and use Unity3D, and where I realized the game industry was for me.</p>
        <p><h4>For me, programming has always been a tool for artistic expression</h4>: I started coding at 12 to customize my Neopets page in HTML and CSS. Since then, I took 3 years of Java in high school and decided to major in computer science in college. I've always been a gamer, but my passion for programming shifted gears from web design to games when I started watching the Extra Credits series on game design on Penny Arcade. I created my first two games at Heatwave the summer before I started college, teaching myself Unity and C# along the way, and game development has been my focus ever since. My use of programming as artistic expression, along with the game design education from Extra Credits, is why I care so much about video games as an art form.</p>
        <p><h4>I'm also dedicated to helping tech and gaming minorities feel welcomed.</h4> I'm the president and co-founder of a new student organized of 50+ members called Women in Computer Science. We're hosting a game jam the weekend of November 6-8, which I'm primarily responsible for organizing, including fundraising, logistics, and marketing. WICS also has regular tutoring sessions, professional development workshops, socials, and other events. If you're interested in learning more, contact wicslsu@gmail.com.</p>
        <p><h4>I'm active in the local game development community</h4> and have spoken twice at IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings and once at a New Orleans game developer meet-up. You can watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMnLcmWts0" title="Alexandra Willis free to play games livestream">presentation on free-to-play mobile games from the NOLA meet-up here</a>. I've regularly attended the IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings since Pixel Dash introduced me to them in the summer of 2013.</p>
        <p><h4>My hobbies</h4> include gaming (obviously), digital art, and traditional art. The first game I ever obsessed over was Kingdom Hearts, which remains one of my favorites to this day. Other favorites include the Mass Effect series, Spec Ops: The Line, Transistor (I study to that soundtrack!), Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and the first three Assassin's Creed games. I spend a lot of time on itch.io, checking on the latest innovations in experimental and artsy games. (...Also because it's cheap and I'm a broke college student.)  I'm also a bit of an adrenaline junkie. <a href="http://wowsuchscotland.tumblr.com/">I spent a semester studying abroad in Scotland</a>, traveling to Ireland, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, England, and Poland. I also started working on my solo skydiving lisence last year, but I'll have to pick that back up when I get a big-girl job that pays enough for it. ;)</p></div>
