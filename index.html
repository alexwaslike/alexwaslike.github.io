<p>Games are my passion. I've spent the last four summers working for video game studios, all of which I've used C# in Unity3D. Most recently, I worked at EA Mobile in Austin on the upcoming mobile collectible character game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. The previous two summers, I worked at Pixel Dash, an independent game studio local to Baton Rouge, best known for Road Redemption. The summer before I started college, I did a mentorship program at independent Austin studio Heatwave Interactive, where I first learned to write C# and use Unity3D.</p>
<p>I'm dedicated to helping tech and gaming minorities feel welcomed. I'm the president and co-founder of a new student organized called Women in Computer Science of 50+ members. We're hosting a game jam the weekend of November 6-8, which I'm primarily responsible for organizing, including fundraising, logistics, marketing, and all of that fun stuff. On top of that, WICS has regular tutoring sessions, professional development workshops, socials, and other events.</p>
<p>I'm also active in the local game development community and have spoken twice at IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings and once at a New Orleans game developer meet-up. You can watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMnLcmWts0" title="Alexandra Willis free to play games livestream">presentation on free-to-play mobile games from the NOLA meet-up here. I've regularly attended the IGDA-Baton Rouge meetings since Pixel Dash introduced me to them.</a></p></div>
